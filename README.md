The median (MED) is a crucial statistic for measuring the central tendency of a set of quantitative elements. However, computing the exact MED is costly, and even state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms struggle to meet the demands of modern scientific data. Therefore, approximate MED is often considered a more feasible solution.
We propose a novel, simple and efficient approximate MED finding algorithm CG-MED and a fine-grained implementation of CG-MED, called FG-MED.

---- The first three datasets can be found at Scientific Data Reduction Benchmarks suite (https://sdrbench.github.io/).

---- The _power_ dataset consists of Global Active Power measurements from the UCI Individual household electric power consumption dataset.

---- The Moving MNIST and Lena datasets are significant datasets for computer version from Kaggle public dataset.

---- The last three datasets are synthetic.

## Data generation
  1. Read Image/vedio
     If you want to test the dataset Lena or Moving MNIST, you could get it from ./data_generate/readImage.py or ./data_generate/readVedio.py.
     
  2. Generate the synthetic datasets
     If you want to test three synthetic dataset, you could get it from ./data_generate/gene Constant.c or geneNormal.c or geneZipf.c.
